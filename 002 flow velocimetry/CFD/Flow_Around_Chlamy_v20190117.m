% Update Log of Flow_Around_Chlamy... . m (FAC*.m)
% Date: 2014-06.      Created.     by Daniel Tam
% Date: 2017-07-18.   Organized.   Wei Da
%     Some organization is called for after several users has worked
%     with sults.
%         User dependent. One may edit directly the FAC_004_SaveResults.m
%         file in the switchthis program. The organization of the code is as follows:
%      
%     001. Add paths to include functions and necessary files. 
%         As this code will be used on different computers, this part is
%         fully user dependent. Please modify the FAC_001_AddPath.m such
%         that your own filepaths are included in the switch structure
%     002. Set the operational mode of the code, load or creat necessary
%         parameters for the following simulation.
%         The structure of this part is not user dependent. In case that  
%         some values such as flag stiffness, flag radius need to be
%         changed, user should notify others or simply do it in one's local
%         version
%     003. Compute the flow field around a chlamy cell. 
%         FAC_003_CalcImgSequence_CORE.m
%         This part should not be modified as it directly affects the 
%         validity of the computation. Any change must be annouced to
%         all the users of this code and updating this DOC at the same time. 
%     004. Save simulation re structure.
%
% Date: 2017-11-13.   FAC_003_CORE updated by Daniel. 
%     1. Redundant calculation of Y1 and Y2 were deleted (it was Y1(2)s
%     that were used.
%     2. Flagella shape coordiantes were calculated now using
%     curv2xy_quick.m, instead of flagella_quick.m. The former is the one
%     how the clicked coordinates got into curvature in the first place.
% 
% Date: 2019-01-19.   FAC_003_CORE organized. 
%     1. Code organized, redundant part deleted.
%     2. Note that Phi (rate of work) lacks a kinematic viscosity
